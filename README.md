# Twelve-Factor Applications with Liberty

This sample contains an example for a Twelve-Factor Application that can be run on Liberty and Bluemix. A Twelve-Factor App is an application that follows the methodology described here: [12factor.net](12factor.net) and is also a great methodology to use when following a microservices architecture.

* Building this sample:
	* [Building with Gradle](/docs/Building-the-sample.md#building-with-gradle)
	* [Building with Maven](/docs/Building-the-sample.md#building-with-maven)
* [Downloading WAS Liberty](/docs/Downloading-WAS-Liberty.md)
* Running the application:
	* Starting the local server using [Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)
	* Deploying the application onto [Bluemix](/docs/Deploying-application-to-Bluemix.md)
* [Creating a Cloudant database on bluemix](/docs/Creating-Cloudant-database.md)

Once the server has been started, go to http://localhost:9082/12-factor-application/ to view the sample locally or the route of your application to view the sample being hosted on Bluemix.
